## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Virtual environment not found" Error
**Solution**: Your administrator needs to run the setup script first before packaging the folder for you.

**Administrator should run:**
- **Mac**: `./setup_auto.sh` then package the entire folder
- **Windows**: `setup_auto.bat` then package the entire folder

### ".env file not found" Error
**Solution**: Make sure the `.env` file is in the **main application folder**, not in a subfolder.

### "Port 5001 is already in use" Error
**Solution**: The application is already running! Close the previous window or restart your computer.

### Jobs Stay in "Queued" Status Forever
**Problem**: The background worker is not running.

**Solution**: 
1. Stop the application (Ctrl+C on Mac, or close window on Windows)
2. Run the startup script again: 
   - Mac: `./start_app.sh`
   - Windows: Double-click `start_app.bat`

The new startup scripts automatically start BOTH the web server and the worker!

### Application Won't Start
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure you're in the correct folder (the one with `start_app.sh` or `start_app.bat`)
2. Make sure you have the `.env` file in the folder
3. Contact your administrator for help

## üìû Still Need Help?

Contact your administrator with:
1. A screenshot of the error message
2. What operating system you're using (Mac/Windows)
3. What step you're stuck on
