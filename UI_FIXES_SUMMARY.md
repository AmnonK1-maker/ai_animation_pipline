# UI Fixes Applied - Summary

## ✅ Fix 1: Job Card Button Alignment & Text Wrapping

**Changes Made:**
- Added `display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: space-between` to `.job-info`
- This makes the job info section stretch vertically
- Buttons now align to the bottom of the thumbnail

**Text Wrapping:**
- Changed `.job-prompt` from `white-space: nowrap` (single line with ellipsis)
- To `-webkit-line-clamp: 2` with `-webkit-box-orient: vertical`
- Prompts now wrap to 2 lines maximum instead of cutting off

**Button Positioning:**
- Added `margin-top: auto` and `padding-top: 8px` to `.job-actions`
- Buttons stay at the bottom even if prompt is short

**Result:** Job cards look cleaner, text doesn't overflow, and buttons are consistently positioned at the bottom aligned with thumbnails.

## ✅ Fix 2: Removable Reference Images

**Changes Made:**

### Added Remove Buttons:
- Red circular (X) button in top-right corner of each reference image
- Style: `position: absolute; top: 8px; right: 8px;`
- Red background (`rgba(220,53,69,0.95)`) with white text
- Round button (28px × 28px) with shadow

### JavaScript Functions:

**Updated `setupImageReferenceUpload()`:**
- Now finds and manages the remove button
- Shows remove button when image is uploaded
- Prevents file dialog from opening when clicking remove button

**New `removeReferenceImage(type)` function:**
- Clears the file input
- Hides preview image and shows placeholder
- Hides remove button
- Resets upload area styling
- Prevents event bubbling to avoid triggering file dialog

**Updated `editJob()` function:**
- When loading existing jobs, now shows remove button for reference images
- Allows users to remove pre-loaded reference images from previous jobs

**Result:** Users can now easily remove style/color reference images without having to reload the page or re-upload. This prevents re-analyzing the same images when editing a job.

## ✅ Fix 3: Panel Division (40% / 60%)

**Status:** Already configured correctly!

- Tool panel: `width: 40%;` (lines 68-70)
- Queue panel: Takes remaining 60% automatically via flex layout

**No changes needed** - the panel split was already at the requested ratio.

---

## ✅ Fix 4: Remove Popup Messages (Except Delete)

**Status:** Already implemented!

**Search Results:** No `alert()` calls found in the template

**Current Implementation:**
- The app uses `showUserFriendlyError()` for notifications (toast-style, non-blocking)
- Delete operations have proper confirmation dialogs (as requested)
- No intrusive popup messages interrupt workflow

**No changes needed** - popup messages were already removed in a previous update.
